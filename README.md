# naturalistic_social_gaze_mech

Repo to investigate patterns of behavior observed during naturalistic gaze exchange between two primates. Simultaneous timeseries of gaze locations recorded from two individuals are mined to find islands of steriotypical fixation and saccade behavior. The transition probabilities of various socially relavant behaviors are investigated to eventually understand inter-agent interactions.
